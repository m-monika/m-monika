# Hi 👋

I'm Monika 😄

I have been programing in commercial projects since 10.2014. Mostly in ***PHP*** 🐘. I know a little of ***Java*** ☕ and ***Python*** 🐍 😉

If you want to know more about me, you can find me on Twitter [@MonikaMlodzik](https://twitter.com/MonikaMlodzik/), LinkedIn [m-monika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-monika/) or Instagram [@m_monika.m](https://www.instagram.com/m_monika.m/).

I share most of IT stuff on Instagram stories. I like walking and taking pictures, that's why you will find a lot of nature pictures on my Instagram 😊
